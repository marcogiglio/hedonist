The wine-pairing choices are excellent, with three different options: one based on more classic wines, another which allows guests to explore natural wines and highly individual labels, and a third non-alcoholic option featuring home-made drinks. Among the house specialities which are nearly always present on the menu, don’t miss the corn beignet with fermented cottage cheese and smoked trout roe, and the hay-baked potatoes with fenugreek and roasted yeast-infused sour cream – the latter is a very simple dish that offers an interesting take on a childhood favourite. Should you decide to spend the night here, the copious and highly colourful breakfast is equally recommended."

Premium produce, generous classical cuisine and the added dimension that wine can bring to a dish are the foundations of this family’s values. Éric, a past master of old school cooking, who can rely entirely on his right-hand man, David Cataudela, crafts nostalgic food that spans the annals of French cookery. You can expect to sample classic produce such as pigeon, pig’s trotters and sole (prepared à la Fernand Point, no less!) courtesy of almost-forgotten recipes. The sauces are in a class of their own, illustrated by a fresh, fruity, tangy blackcurrant jus that enhances venison. The jaw-dropping range of timeless à la carte and seasonal set menus reveal the establishment’s desire to bend over backwards to suit its customers. This elegant restaurant is ideal for both special occasion decadence and everyday classical fare. The chef, who often pops out to greet diners and chat with them, enjoys getting first-hand feedback from his diners."

The many natural features lend individuality to the contemporary comfort of the decor. And that is no accident. His fascinating and original approach to nature emphasises vegetables, local produce and sustainability. Biodynamic growers have become regular suppliers and the chef has also banished all dairy products from his kitchen. His search for solutions feeds his creativity and has resulted in a very pure style of cooking.Each dish has surprises in store. The small plates keep you on your toes up to the very last bite. Chef Van Kranen gives oysters from the Eastern Scheldt a twist by combining them with seaweed and a deeply aromatic dashi bouillon. Quail is boned and all its meat cut out. The bird is then stuffed again before being cooked to perfection. It is juicy, having been slowly roasted in butter, ready to be served with fine seasonal vegetables and a powerful, subtly sweetened sauce. Bas van Kranen's cuisine has personality, and he clearly takes pride in working with Dutch produce. He also has the confidence to cook just the way he wants to."
