The wine-pairing choices are excellent, with three different options: one based on more classic wines, another which allows guests to explore natural wines and highly individual labels, and a third non-alcoholic option featuring home-made drinks. Among the house specialities which are nearly always present on the menu, don’t miss the corn beignet with fermented cottage cheese and smoked trout roe, and the hay-baked potatoes with fenugreek and roasted yeast-infused sour cream – the latter is a very simple dish that offers an interesting take on a childhood favourite. Should you decide to spend the night here, the copious and highly colourful breakfast is equally recommended."

Hidden among the private beach clubs that crowd Senigallia’s seafront, this three-Michelin-star restaurant comes as a surprise, surrounded as it is by beach parasols and the sound of the sea lapping on the shore. The strength and originality of Uliassi’s cuisine lies in his ability to make good use of local ingredients, taking inspiration from the culinary traditions that have been so familiar and successful along this coastline over the past few decades and giving them a personal, creative twist. Fish and seafood obviously take pride of place, although there’s also room on the menu for meat, inspired by the Marche’s traditional game dishes – the delicious skewered pigeon is cooked to perfection! The colourful dining experience here is enhanced by the owner’s warm welcome, with Mauro’s sister Catia and his son Filippo working alongside the chef. It’s also worth mentioning that the restaurant has a keen focus on the environment, hence its banning of the use of plastic and doing its utmost to persuade its fish suppliers not to use polystyrene to transport their fish."

La Paix now blends Brussels’ heritage with Japanese minimalism, depicted by a shimmering flock of origami birds dangling from the ceiling and soft lighting, setting an almost reverential vibe as Martin and his team add the final touch to their creations on the “altar”. You can choose between three set menus, named after the chef’s father and the parents of Nathalie, the lady of the house. The menus blend purebred Gallicism and Japanese purity, with a highly creative personal twist, often embodied by Norwegian seafood. Chef Martin is on a permanent quest for perfection. The flavours are bold, often contrasted, such as a lemon stuffed with stracciatella, fresh tartare of langoustine, yuzu, caviar and a hint of miso. Or how about a disruptive crunchy moshi stuffed with earthy chicory, velvety tuna and a creamy layer of black miso and Jerusalem artichoke? David Martin is a larger-than-life chef who is determined to chart new culinary territories."

Imagine: a short menu, comprising just eight dishes to be mixed and matched as you please (four or five of these small plates amount to a meal). The talented chef's technical approach always hits the mark, from the judicious combinations to the quality produce enhanced without any showboating, not to mention the impeccable garnishes and seasonings. Examples include breaded red mullet, kale and sour cream; line-caught hake with an oyster and mint ravigote sauce. Wine, too, takes centre stage here: over 700 ready-to-drink labels (plus plenty more in the cellar), ranging from big names to small-scale producers – something for every budget! Sommeliers first and foremost, the head servers make a point of promoting young winemakers."

The hotel has everything you need for a good night's rest, but first, it's time to experience the finesse of Stéphanie Thunus's cooking. She is a perfectionist who does not do things just for show. Take the French and regional produce that she loves to work with, such as game from the Ardennes. Her culinary creations are distinctive and generous, but at the same time well-thought-out and subtle. For example, she presents local poultry in different ways to highlight its versatility. She combines the fillets with an intensely flavoursome vegetable stock. She also serves two supremes (with crispy skin!) accompanied by a creamed chicken stock for extra depth. As the daughter of farmers, Stéphanie Thunus has respect for produce and, as a talented chef, she gives it that extra dimension."
